This mushroom shaped cavity, operating in TE<jats:sub>01</jats:sub>mode, creates a unique distribution of surface fields. The surface magnetic field on the sample wafer is 3.75 times greater than elsewhere on the Niobium cavity surface. This field design is made possible through dielectrically loading the cavity by locating a hemisphere of ultra-pure sapphire just above the sample wafer. The sapphire pulls the fields away from the walls so the maximum field the Nb surface sees is 25% of the surface field on the sample. In this manner, it should be possible to drive the sample wafer well beyond the BCS limit for Niobium while still maintaining a respectable Q. The sapphire's purity must be tested for its loss tangent and dielectric constant to finalize the design of the mushroom test cavity. A sapphire loaded CEBAF cavity has been constructed and tested. The results on the dielectric constant and loss tangent will be presented.</jats:p>\",\n",

This field design is made possible through dielectrically loading the cavity by locating a hemisphere of ultra-pure sapphire just above the sample wafer. The sapphire pulls the fields away from the walls so the maximum field the Nb surface sees is 25% of the surface field on the sample. In this manner, it should be possible to drive the sample wafer well beyond the BCS limit for Niobium while still maintaining a respectable Q.

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions.

It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.</jats:p>',\n",

The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100° temperature range from −37.5 to 62.5\\u200a°C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm−3. Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone-pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4\\u200a°C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations.

However, despite the availability of object detection algorithms, challenges persist in detecting fires and smoke. These challenges include slow convergence speed, poor performance in detecting small targets, and high computational cost limiting deployments. In this paper, Fire smoke and human detection based on ConvNeXt and Mixed encoder (FCM-DETR), an end-to-end object detection algorithm based on Deformable DETR, is proposed. Firstly, we introduce ConvNeXt to take the place of Resnet, which greatly reduces the amount of computation and improves the ability to extract irregular flame features. Secondly, to effectively process multi-scale features, the original encoder is decoupled into two modules. Then Mixed encoder, an innovative encoder structure, is proposed, resulting in excellent performance of multi-scale fire and smoke features fusion. What can’t be overlooked is that the encoder block is compatible with any DETR-based models. Finally, the convergence speed is accelerated and the mean of average precision is improved by applying a novel loss function called Powerful IoU v2. The experimental results indicate that our model achieves the best detection accuracy compared to other models, with mAP reaching 66.7%, mAPs and Accuracyfire achieving impressive 50.2% and 98.05%, respectively.</jats:p>',\n",

The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1bar is 272.2K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties.

       "       '<jats:p>Thermodynamic integration along a path that coincides with the saturation line is proposed as an efficient means for evaluation of phase equilibria by molecular simulation. The technique allows coexistence to be determined by just one simulation, without ever attempting or performing particle insertions. Prior knowledge of one coexistence point is required to start the procedure. Integration then advances from this state according to the Clapeyron formula—a first-order ordinary differential equation that prescribes how the pressure must change with temperature to maintain coexistence. The method is unusual in the context of thermodynamic integration in that the path is not known at the outset of the process; results from each simulation determine the course that the integration subsequently takes. Predictor–corrector methods among standard numerical techniques are shown to be particularly well suited for this type of integration. A typical integration step along the saturation line proceeds as follows: An increment in the temperature is chosen, and the saturation pressure at the new temperature is ‘‘predicted’’ from previous data (the initial coexistence datum and/or previous simulations). Simultaneous but independent NPT simulations of the coexisting phases are initiated at the said conditions. Averages taken throughout the simulations are repeatedly used to ‘‘correct’’ the estimate of the pressure to convergence. Thus strictly the pressure is not fixed during the simulation. Vapor–liquid coexistence of the van der Waals model is first used to study the numerical integration method without the complications of molecular simulation. In a second application the phase envelope of the Lennard-Jones model fluid is computed, and many variations of the technique are examined. Overall, the results are remarkably consistent and in agreement with previous simulation studies. Difficulty is encountered upon approach of the critical point, but, by artificially coupling the simulation volumes, the method remains effective in this regime so long as a suitably small integration step is employed. Many extensions and improvements of the technique are discussed.</jats:p>',\n",

Lett.\\u200892, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs–Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys.\\u200898, 4149 (1993)] to evaluate the melting temperature of ice Ih for other potential models of water. We have found that the melting temperatures of ice Ih for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T=190K, 215K, 146K, 232K, 245K, and 274K, respectively. The relative stability of ice Ih with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice Ih is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice Ih is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H–O–H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the Ih and II ice forms.

       "       '<jats:p>We examine five different popular rigid water models (SPC, SPCE, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP5P) using molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the hydrophobic hydration and interaction of apolar Lennard-Jones solutes as a function of temperature in the range between 275 and 375 K along the 0.1 MPa isobar. For all investigated models and state points we calculate the excess chemical potential for the noble gases and methane employing the Widom particle insertion technique. All water models exhibit too small hydration entropies, but show a clear hierarchy. TIP3P shows poorest agreement with experiment, whereas TIP5P is closest to the experimental data at lower temperatures and SPCE is closest at higher temperatures. As a first approximation, this behavior can be rationalized as a temperature shift with respect to the solvation behavior found in real water. A rescaling procedure inspired by the information theory model of Hummer et al. [Chem. Phys. 258, 349 (2000)] suggests that the different solubility curves for the different models and real water can be largely explained on the basis of the different density curves at constant pressure. In addition, the models that give a good representation of the water structure at ambient conditions (TIP5P, SPCE, and TIP4P) show considerably better agreement with the experimental data than the ones which exhibit less structured O–O correlation functions (SPC and TIP3P). In the second part of the paper we calculate the hydrophobic interaction between xenon particles directly from a series of 60 ns simulation runs. We find that the temperature dependence of the association is to a large extent related to the strength of the solvation entropy. Nevertheless, differences between the models seem to require a more detailed molecular picture. The TIP5P model shows by far the strongest temperature dependence. The suggested density rescaling is also applied to the chemical potential in the xenon–xenon contact-pair configuration, indicating the presence of a temperature where the hydrophobic interaction turns into purely repulsive. The predicted association for xenon in real water suggests the presence of a strong variation with temperature, comparable to the behavior found for TIP5P water. Comparing different water models and experimental data we conclude that a proper description of density effects is an important requirement for a water model to account correctly for the correct description of the hydrophobic effects. A water model exhibiting a density maximum at the correct temperature is desirable.</jats:p>',\n",

Water completely changes its character from ambient to supercritical conditions in a way that makes it possible to sustain life at extreme conditions, leading to conjectures that life may have originated in deep-sea vents. Molecular simulation can be very useful in exploring biological and chemical systems, particularly at extreme conditions for which experiments are either difficult or impossible; however this scenario entails an accurate molecular model for water applicable over a wide range of state conditions. Here, we present a Gaussian charge polarizable model (GCPM) based on the model developed earlier by Chialvo and Cummings [Fluid Phase Equilib.\\u2008150, 73 (1998)] which is, to our knowledge, the first that satisfies the water monomer and dimer properties, and simultaneously yields very accurate predictions of dielectric, structural, vapor-liquid equilibria, and transport properties, over the entire fluid range. This model would be appropriate for simulating biological and chemical systems at both ambient and extreme conditions. The particularity of the GCPM model is the use of Gaussian distributions instead of points to represent the partial charges on the water molecules. These charge distributions combined with a dipole polarizability and a Buckingham exp-6 potential are found to play a crucial role for the successful and simultaneous predictions of a variety of water properties. This work not only aims at presenting an accurate model for water, but also at proposing strategies to develop classical accurate models for the predictions of structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties.</jats:p>',\n",

In COS models, the polarization is represented via a self-consistently induced dipole moment consisting of a pair of separated charges. A previous polarizable water model (COS/B2), upon which the improved versions are based, was developed by Yu, Hansson, and van Gunsteren [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 221 (2003)]. To improve the COS/B2 model, which overestimated the dielectric permittivity, one additional virtual atomic site was used to reproduce the water monomer quadrupole moments besides the water monomer dipole moment in the gas phase. The molecular polarizability, residing on the virtual atomic site, and Lennard-Jones parameters for oxygen-oxygen interactions were varied to reproduce the experimental values for the heat of vaporization and the density of liquid water at room temperature and pressure. The improved models were used to study the properties of liquid water at various thermodynamic states as well as gaseous water clusters and ice. Overall, good agreement is obtained between simulated properties and those derived from experiments and ab initio calculations. The COS/G2 and COS/G3 models may serve as simple, classical, rigid, polarizable water models for the study of organic solutes and biopolymers. Due to its simplicity, COS type of polarization can straightforwardly be used to introduce explicit polarization into (bio)molecular force fields.</jats:p>',\n",

This paper reviews various image-based obstacle detection techniques employed by unmanned vehicles such as Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). More than 110 papers from 23 high-impact computer science journals, which were published over the past 20 years, were reviewed. The techniques were divided into monocular and stereo. The former uses a single camera, while the latter makes use of images taken by two synchronised cameras. Monocular obstacle detection methods are discussed in appearance-based, motion-based, depth-based, and expansion-based categories. Monocular obstacle detection approaches have simple, fast, and straightforward computations. Thus, they are more suited for robots like MAVs and compact UAVs, which usually are small and have limited processing power. On the other hand, stereo-based methods use pair(s) of synchronised cameras to generate a real-time 3D map from the surrounding objects to locate the obstacles. Stereo-based approaches have been classified into Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)-based and disparity histogram-based methods. Whether aerial or terrestrial, disparity histogram-based methods suffer from common problems: computational complexity, sensitivity to illumination changes, and the need for accurate camera calibration, especially when implemented on small robots. In addition, until recently, both monocular and stereo methods relied on conventional image processing techniques and, thus, did not meet the requirements of real-time applications. Therefore, deep learning networks have been the centre of focus in recent years to develop fast and reliable obstacle detection solutions. However, we observed that despite significant progress, deep learning techniques also face difficulties in complex and unknown environments where objects of varying types and shapes are present. The review suggests that detecting narrow and small, moving obstacles and fast obstacle detection are the most challenging problem to focus on in future studies.</jats:p>',\n",

In particular, we find that the experimental TMD line lies between the TMD lines of the SPC/E and ST2 models of water, so perhaps the behavior of these two models of simulated water “bracket” the behavior of real water. As temperature decreases, we find (i) that maxima appear in isotherms of the isothermal compressibility as a function of density, (ii) that isotherms of the internal energy as a function of volume display negative curvature and (iii) that the pressure of the liquid–vapor spinodal decreases. We compare the results to corresponding behavior found from simulations of the ST2 model of water and find that the behavior of SPC/E, when shifted to higher values of temperature and pressure (ΔP≈50\\u2009MPa and ΔT≈80\\u2009K), approximates that of ST2.

As a result it accurately reproduces the structural and thermodynamic properties of water over a wide range of conditions. Moreover, by allowing for electronic polarization when evaluating the total dipole moment of the simulated fluid, the model leads to the correct value of the dielectric constant for virtually any state point. At room temperature the calculation produces an average dipole moment of 3.09 D, in accord with recent theoretical and experimental evaluations.

The reproduction of this maximum is a stringent test for potential models used commonly in simulations of water. The relation between the melting temperature and the temperature of maximum density for these potential models is unknown mainly due to our ignorance about the melting temperature of these models. Recently we have determined the melting temperature of ice Ih for several commonly used models of water (SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P). In this work we locate the temperature of maximum density for these models. In this way the relative location of the temperature of maximum density with respect to the melting temperature is established. For SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P/Ew the maximum in density occurs at about 21–37K above the melting temperature. In all these models the negative charge is located either on the oxygen itself or on a point along the H–O–H bisector. For the TIP5P and TIP5P-E models the maximum in density occurs at about 11K above the melting temperature.

A critical idea of SCD is how to identify interesting changes while overcoming noisy changes induced by camera motion or environment variation, such as viewpoint, dynamic changes and outdoor conditions. The noisy changes cause corresponding pixel pairs to have spatial difference (position relation) and temporal difference (intensity relation). Due to the limitation of local receptive field, it is difficult for traditional models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to establish long-range relations for the semantic changes. In order to address the above challenges, we explore the potential of a transformer in SCD and propose a transformer-based SCD architecture (TransCD). From the intuition that a SCD model should be able to model both interesting and noisy changes, we incorporate a siamese vision transformer (SViT) in a feature difference SCD framework. Our motivation is that SViT is able to establish global semantic relations and model long-range context, which is more robust to noisy changes. In addition, different from the pure CNN-based models with high computational complexity, the proposed model is more efficient and has fewer parameters. Extensive experiments on the CDNet-2014 dataset demonstrate that the proposed TransCD (SViT-E1-D1-32) outperforms the state-of-the-art SCD models and achieves 0.9361 in terms of the F1 score with an improvement of 7.31%.</jats:p>',\n",

We have found that the different density partitioning schemes lead to widely different values for the molecular multipoles, illustrating how poorly defined molecular multipoles are in clusters and condensed environments. For instance, the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment in ice Ih ranges between 2.3 D and 3.1 D depending on the partitioning scheme used. Within each scheme, though, the value for the molecular dipole moment in ice is larger than in the hexamer.
